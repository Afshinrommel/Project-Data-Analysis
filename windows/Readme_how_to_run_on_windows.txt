Here’s a clear, step-by-step description of what I ran your Python code based on your provided commands:

### **Description of the Steps Taken to Run the Python Code**

1. **Navigated to the project directory**

I changed the current working directory to the project folder using the command:

```

CD "C:\Users\Dell\Documents\semester 5\data_analysis_project\on windows"

```

This ensures that all subsequent commands run within your project’s location.

2. **Created a Virtual Environment**

I created an isolated Python environment named `venv` using:

```

python -m venv venv

```

This helps keep project dependencies separate from the global Python packages.

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

I activated the virtual environment in PowerShell using the following command:

```

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

```

Once activated, the environment ensures that Python commands use the local interpreter and libraries.

4. **Upgraded Core Python Packaging Tools**

I upgraded `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` to their latest versions using the Python executable within the virtual environment:

```

& "C:\Users\Dell\Documents\semester 5\data_analysis_project\on windows\venv\Scripts\python.exe" -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

```

This ensures compatibility and smooth installation of other dependencies.

5. **Installed Project Dependencies**

I installed all the required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file using:

```

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

This step ensures that all necessary modules are available for your project to run.

6. **Executed the Python script**

Finally, I ran your main project script.

```

python hotel_v3_advisor_coherence_local.py

```

This executed your Python program within the prepared virtual environment.
