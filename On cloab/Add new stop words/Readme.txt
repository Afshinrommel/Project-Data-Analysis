During execution, the program automatically requested access to the requirements.txt file to 
install all the necessary Python packages and dependencies for the project. Additionally, 
as part of the data acquisition process, the colab prompted me to enter my Kaggle username 
and API key to authenticate and download the required dataset directly from Kaggle.
 Once authentication and installations were completed, the program proceeded to run the 
 topic modeling workflow in Colabâ€™s cloud-based Python environment.
